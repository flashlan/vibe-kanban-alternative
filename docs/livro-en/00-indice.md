# Modern Vibe Coding Manual — Table of Contents

**Subtitle:** *A practical guide to the Vibe Kanban Alternative interface — from `npx` to a production SaaS, with a guided project.*

This book was written inside the very repository it teaches you to use. Every file path cited exists in the code; when an external rule changes (e.g., KDP prices), the chapter marks the verification date.

## How to use this book

- **Part I (ch. 1–9):** the usage manual — start with the vibe coding vocabulary (ch. 2), then install, navigate, work with cards, pipelines and git, and close with the practical project **Building a SaaS with Vibe Kanban** and the Amazon KDP publication.
- **Part II (ch. 10–15):** behind the scenes for those who want to customize — architecture, generated types, the engineering loop, orchestration and image anchoring.
- **Appendix:** quick command reference.
- The Amazon publication checklist lives in `../livro-vibe-kanban-amazon-checklist.md`.
